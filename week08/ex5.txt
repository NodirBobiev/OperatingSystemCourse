The physical address refers to a location in the memory. It allows access to data in the main memory. A physical address is not directly accessible to the user program hence, a virtual address needs to be mapped to it to make the address accessible.

The virtual address is an address that is generated by the CPU during program execution. A virtual address doesn't exist physically. The virtual address is used as a reference to access the virtual address.
